C1 = 0.1uF ceramic capacitor
C2 = 22pf ceramic capacitor
C3 = 22pf ceramic capacitor
C4 = 10uF/16volt electrolytic capacitor
C5 = 10uF/16volt electrolytic capacitor
C6 = 10uF/16volt electrolytic capacitor
C7 = 10uF/16volt electrolytic capacitor
R1 = 10k ohm resistor
X1 = 16 MHz crystal  (14.31818 MHz)
U1 = 8k-by-8 bits SRAM  HM6264,   (v2a=HM62256)
U2 = 8k-by-8 bits EEPROM  AT28c64b  (also fits 27c64)
U3 = PLD  ATF20v8b  (v2a=22v10)
U4 = MC10466  (also fits CD4066)
U5 = SN74LS197  (using it as a 4-bit latch)
U6 = ATMega328  (pulled from Arduino UNO, where just a USB cable can program it)
--------
Notes:
(1) the ATF20v8b was chosen because my G540 will program it, no UV light is needed to erase.
(2) the AT28C64b was chosen because there is no need for an erase cycle, the EEPROM is written to with just a "poke" and then "peek" until your value shows up.
(3) J2 will not be used in production, but supplies an easy way to program the UNO chip outside of the $14 Arduino prototype board.
